### This folder contains just the final products that most users and land managers will hopefully find most useful. 

The file: **Final_loading_modelDISTRIBUTE_Table.csv**  contains the same information contained in the shapefile **Final_loading_model_DISTRIBUTE.shp** attribute table. Note that shapefiles can be opened in ArcGIS or Qgis. 

The .kmz file **Final_loading_model_Google_Earth.kmz** can be opened in Google Earth. It will display the Final_loading_model_DISTRIBUTE shapefile and is colored by total loading. Generally clicking on a watershed within Google Earth will bring up the model data assosiated with each watershed. 

Please email me if you have any questions!
